# Structural Design Pattern
Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. 
Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations. As a simple example, 
consider how multiple inheritance mixes two or more classes into one. The result is a class that combines 
the properties of its parent classes. This pattern is particularly useful for making independently developed 
class libraries work together
