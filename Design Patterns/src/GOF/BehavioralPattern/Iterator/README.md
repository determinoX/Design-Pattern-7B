# Iterator (Cursor)
## Intent
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying 
representation
## Applicability

Use the Iterator pattern

● to access an aggregate object's contents without exposing its internal representation.

● to support multiple traversals of aggregate objects.

● to provide a uniform interface for traversing different aggregate structures (that is, to support polymorphic iteration).
