# Behavioral Design Pattern
Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between 
objects. Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of 
communication between them. These patterns characterize complex control flow that's difficult to follow 
at run-time. They shift your focus away from flow of control to let you concentrate just on the way 
objects are interconnected.
