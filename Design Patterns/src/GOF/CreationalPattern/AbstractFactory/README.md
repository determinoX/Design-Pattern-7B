# Abstract Factory (Kit)
## Intent
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
## Applicability
Use the Abstract Factory pattern when

* a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
* a system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.
* a family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint.
* you want to provide a class library of products, and you want to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations.
