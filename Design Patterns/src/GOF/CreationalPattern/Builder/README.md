# Builder
## Intent
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
## Applicability

Use the Builder pattern when

* the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and how they're assembled.

* the construction process must allow different representations for the object that's constructed.
