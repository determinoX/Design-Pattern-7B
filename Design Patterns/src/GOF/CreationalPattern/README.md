# Creational Design Pattern
Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of 
how its objects are created, composed, and represented. A class creational pattern uses inheritance to 
vary the class that's instantiated, whereas an object creational pattern will delegate instantiation to 
another object. Creational patterns become important as systems evolve to depend more on object composition than class 
inheritance.
