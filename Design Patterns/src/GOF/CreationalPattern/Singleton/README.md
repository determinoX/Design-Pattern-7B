# Singleton
## Intent
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
## Applicability

Use the Singleton pattern when

* there must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point.

* when the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing, and clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying their code.
