# Design-Pattern-7B

Welcome to my Design-Pattern-7B repository! This repository is dedicated to providing information and coding examples related to various design principles. Additionally, it serves as a platform for sharing insights and understanding related to different design patterns.

# Design Principles
An up-to-date list of design patterns that I have learned so far.
# [Behavioral Pattern](https://github.com/determinoX/Design-Pattern-7B/tree/main/Design%20Pattern/GOF/Behavioral%20Pattern)
## ChainOfResponsibility
### Intent
Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
## Iterator
### Intent
Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).
## Mediator
### Intent
Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.
## ObserverPattern
### Intent
Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.
## Strategy
### Intent
Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
## TemplateMethod
### Intent
Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
## Visitor
### Intent
Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

# [Creational Pattern](https://github.com/determinoX/Design-Pattern-7B/tree/main/Design%20Pattern/GOF/Creational%20Pattern)
## AbstractFactory
### Intent
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
## Builder
### Intent
Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
## Prototype
### Intent
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
## Singleton
### Intent
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

# [Structural Pattern](https://github.com/determinoX/Design-Pattern-7B/tree/main/Design%20Pattern/GOF/Structural%20Pattern)
## Decorator
### Intent
Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
## Proxy
### Intent
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
